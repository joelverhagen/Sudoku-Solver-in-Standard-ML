This is a Sudoku solver written in Standard ML.

I have only tested this code on Standard ML of New Jersey.

To run the program, open up the SML command-line tool and call the "use" command on the path of sudoku.sml, like so:

- use "/path/to/sudoku.sml";

At this point, the example Sudoku puzzle at the end of sudoku.sml should be solved.
